# handCipherEncryption
Simple encryption using the old Hand Cipher method.

---

### This uses basically the same code from [basicPythonEncryption](https://github.com/GreyBeard42/basicPythonEncryption), except in javascript.

---

## Here's an example of how it works:

Message: "super secret message"

Key: "my key"

### After First Keyword ("my"):

Output: sprsce esgue ertmsae

### After Second Keyword ("key"):

Output: pceuemess g taresersx

The encryption builds with each keyword so make sure your key phrase is decently long!
